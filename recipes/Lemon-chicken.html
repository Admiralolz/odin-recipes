    <p>I don't have the energy or courage to cater for a living but, if I did, this Greek lemon chicken and potatoes would be one of my go-to entrees, and not just for big, fat weddings. 
        It's a proven crowd-pleaser, simple to make, and easy on the wallet. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary </li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
      <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice </li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced </li>
      <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered </li>
      <li>⅔ cup chicken broth, plus splash to deglaze pan </li>
      <li>chopped fresh oregano for garnish </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large roasting pan.</li>
      <li>Place chicken pieces in large bowl. Season with salt, oregano, pepper, rosemary, and cayenne pepper. Add fresh lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic. 
        Place potatoes in bowl with the chicken; stir together until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated with marinade.</li>
      <li>Transfer chicken pieces, skin side up, to prepared roasting pan, reserving marinade. 
        Distribute potato pieces among chicken thighs. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon remainder of marinade over chicken and potatoes.</li>
      <li>Place in preheated oven. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes, keeping chicken skin side up; continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes more. An instant-read 
        thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to serving platter and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Set oven to broil or highest heat setting. Toss potatoes once again in pan juices. 
        Place pan under broiler and broil until potatoes are caramelized, about 3 minutes. Transfer potatoes to serving platter with chicken.</li>
      <li>Place roasting pan on stove over medium heat. Add a splash of broth 
        and stir up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Strain; spoon juices over chicken and potatoes. Top with chopped oregano.</li>
    </ol>
